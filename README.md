### Date created
Git project created on Sept. 12, 2021.

### Project Title
(remote repository) pdsnd_github

### Description
Project 3 - This project is to demonstrate Git and Github proficiency by:
1. forking a repository on Github and setting up a local repository,
2. improving the associated documentation (including this file),
3. refactoring the Bikeshare_2.py code,
4. merging branches to bring all the changes together, and
5. pushing the changes back up to the remote repository.

Resubmit edits:
On pdf submission, added the following command to line 4A (previously only on 4B):
git checkout -b refactoring
since it creates AND checks out the branch in one command.

Was told to do something with the commit messages but I don't understand what the change is.
The commit messages are supposed to follow the Udacity style guide, and I'm not sure where I'm going wrong,
or how to update my project to meet that specification.
I think the reviewer wanted me to use a title AND body for the commit, however they were small changes
and the Udacity style guide says: "Not all commits are complex enough to warrant a body, therefore it is optional and only used when a commit requires a bit of explanation and context."
